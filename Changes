	* NAMESERVER renamed to HAVE_NAMESERVER. Autodetection by configure.
	  May be overwriten by --disable-nameserver
          - tb_ns.4.2.c and tb_ns.fake.c merged into one file tb_ns.c and
	  seperated by #ifdef HAVE_NAMESERVER...
	  - removed TB_NS in Makefile.com	  

	* HAVE_TCP_WRAPPER renamed to HAVE_LIBWRAP. Autodetection by configure.
	
	* <time.h> included in config.h. It's location is determined by
	  configure

	* determination of <dir.h>, <dirent.h>, a.s.o is done by configure
	  definition an include has moved to config.h

	* determination of index/rindex done by configure and moved to config.h

	* return-type of sprintf determined by configure. Define BSD_SPRINTF
	  if char * is returned.

	* uip/Makefile, src/Makefile, lib/Makefile Makefile.com and Makefile
	  are generated by configure.

	* test configure on machine that dosn't support multiple arguments.
	  (check of NO_VARARGS)

	* test for dup2() and fcntl(fd1, F_DUPFD, fd2) done.
	  NODUP2 replaced by HAVE_DUP2 and

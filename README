README -- MMDFII, Patch Level 44+ (alpha), March 2001

	This is the current source tree of the MMDF II 2.45 devellopment version.
It is based on MMDF II 2.44.

CHANGES:
    This release mainly consists of cleanups. But there are also some
    new features that were important at our site. 
    - configure may now be used for setting system dependent compile 
      time options. These have been changed to feature dependent 
      switches. 
    - Files which existed in multiple versions ,like e.g. src/smtp/smtpd.*.c, 
      lib/table/tb_ns.*.c, lib/util/lk_lock.*.c, have been cleaned up.
    - support for header lines longer than 256 characters 
    - 8-bit clean transfer of E-mails (compile time option, default: on)
    - removal of routing information in the envelope "mail from:" lines
      (compile time option, default: on)
    - use of the tcpd/identd-package, if libwrap.a and tcpd.h exist 
      (compile time option, default: on)
    - possibility to use gdbm, if dbm and ndbm are not available. 
      Of course you can always use sequential tables, as before.
    - tables can now be accessed via NIS/NIS+ (compile time option, 
      default: off)
    - possibility to change location of the tables mailids and users
      in mmdftailor (compile time option, default: off)
    - additional information, like e.g. real hostname, real ip-address,
      in the Received: line (run time option in mmdftailor)
    = no cleanups done on uip/ucbmail and uip/unsupported
    (see README.Changes for details)

    different type of operating system would also test this release.
    
DOCUMENTATION:

	If you are already familiar with MMDF and how it works, the first
thing you should do is look at the administrators guide in
doc/administrators.  There is a makefile there to make an nroff or troff
version of "Installing and Operating MMDFII".  Read it.

	There are several other documents which will make the
administrators guide more understandable.  We recommend that novice
installers start with (in order): "MMDF II: A Technical Review",
"Addressing in MMDF II", and (if you plan to use the authorization
features) "Configuring MMDF Authorization", and "Authorization and
Accounting in Store and Forward Message Handling Systems".  Look for these
documents in doc/review, doc/addressing, doc/auth.guide, and
doc/authorization respectively.


MAILING LIST:
	You should probably join the MMDFII mailing list, which is
low-volume and polite.  Postings to the list should be sent to
<mmdf2@skymaster.c2-tech.com> while administrivia should be sent to
<mmdf2-request@skymaster.c2-tech.com>.  


BUG REPORTS & FEEDBACK:
	Please send bug reports to the list <mmdf2@skymaster.c2-tech.com>
or directly to the PL44 maintainer Kai Krueger <krueger@mathematik.uni-kl.de>.


WEB SITES:
	An MMDF User's Group web site is setup at "http://www.mmdf.org".
Other web sites of interest include Mark Vasoll's at
"http://www.c2-tech.com/~vasoll/mmdf" and Jerry Sweet's at
"http://www.irvine.com/~mmdf".


FTP SITE:
	The MMDF Patch Level 44 software package official ftp site is
at the University of Kaiserslauten in Germany:
	ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Sources/mail+news/mmdf/  

	Mirror sites in other locations are sought.  If you're prepared to
run a automated mirror site on an on-going basis and have at least an E3/T3
connection to the Internet, please send email to the MMDF mailing list.

Thanks and much credit is due to Dan Long, Mark Vasoll, Doug Kingston, Phil
Cockcroft, Steve Kille, Howard Walter, and others who put in considerable
time and effort into past MMDF releases.



NOTES:

1.  Be aware that MMDFII is a complete mail system, and as such, replaces
sendmail et. al.  As a result you no longer need the following files:

    /usr/lib/sendmail.*
    /usr/ucb/newaliases
    /etc/aliases
    /etc/delivermail
    /etc/comsat
    /usr/ucb/biff
    /usr/ucb/mailq

2. The following programs are replaced by MMDFII (you may want to save the
original versions).  Note that these "user interface programs" in the
"uip" directory of the distribution have not been updated recently and
aren't portable to all systems.  

    /bin/rmail
    /bin/mail
    /usr/lib/sendmail		MMDFII has a fake sendmail that fools
				most applications

    /usr/ucb/Mail		There are MMDFII versions that work
    /usr/ucb/mail		with MMDFII.   Most people seem to prefer
				to use MMDFII's own user interface (msg/send)
				or MH (6.4 or later).

3.  The modern Internet relies on MX records in the DNS, so most sites
should make sure that NAMESERVER is defined.

4.  There are several freely distributable Mail User Agent software
packages that are MMDF-compatible.  MMDF support is generally
a compile-time option in these packages:  
	Elm
	Exmh
	IMAP-4 Toolkit from Univ. of Washington
	MH
	Mail User's Shell (mush)
	Mutt
	Pine

5. There are other miscellaneous software packages that can be
used with MMDF and might be of interest.  These include:
	John DuBois' "MMDF Administrative Utilities" for SCO UNIX
	PROCMAIL	- A mail sorting package
	MajorDomo	- An automated list manager
	TIN		- An MMDF-compatible NNTP news reader

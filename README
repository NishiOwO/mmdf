README -- MMDFII, Release B (beta), April 22nd, 1986

*****************************************************************************
* This is a beta release of MMDFIIb.  We believe it is quite stable or we   *
* would not have put it out with 4.3 but users should still be aware that   *
* it is beta-test.  The most critical error(s) are listed at the end of     *
* this file.                                                                *

If you are already familiar with MMDF and how it works, 
the first thing you should do is look at the administrators guide
in doc/administrators.  There is a makefile there to make an nroff
or troff version of "Installing and Operating MMDFII".  Read it.

There are several other documents which will make the administrators
guide more understandable.  We recommend that novice installers start
with (in order): "MMDF II: A Technical Review", "Addressing in MMDF
II", and (if you plan to use the authorization features) "Configuring
MMDF Authorization", and "Authorization and Accounting in Store and
Forward Message Handling Systems".  Look for these documents in
doc/review, doc/addressing, doc/auth.guide, and doc/authorization
respectively.

For a current status report on MMDFII, including information on
how to get an up-to-date buglist and updates to the 4.3 distribution,
you should mail a request to the CSNET Info Server (info-server@sh.cs.net).
Simply cut out the following text and mail it to info-server@sh.cs.net for
the current status.

You should also join the MMDFII mailing list.  The list
is mmdf2@relay.cs.net.  Send requests to join/drop/etc to
mmdf2-request@relay.cs.net.  DO NOT CALL BERKELEY with MMDF2
questions.  Send bug reports to mmdf2@relay.cs.net.

Thanks and much credit is due to Doug Kingston, Phil Cockcroft,
Steve Kille, Howard Walter, and others who put in considerable time
and effort into this release.

--------------------------

Comments and Bug list:

1.  The program channel is new and has not been widely used.  Expect
portability problems.

2.   4.2 and 4.3 sites should be aware that MMDFII is a complete mail
system, and as such, replaces sendmail et. al.  As a result you no
longer need the following files:

    /usr/lib/sendmail.*
    /usr/ucb/newaliases
    /etc/aliases
    /etc/delivermail
    /etc/comsat
    /usr/ucb/biff
    /usr/ucb/mailq

The following programs are replaced by MMDFII (you may want to save them)

    /bin/rmail
    /bin/mail
    /usr/lib/sendmail		MMDFII has a fake sendmail that fools
				most applications

    /usr/ucb/Mail		There are MMDFII versions that work
    /usr/ucb/mail		with MMDFII.   Most people seem to prefer
				to use MMDFII's own user interface (msg/send)
				or MH (6.4 or later).

3.  Internet sites which want to interact with nameservers and use MX
RR's should make sure that NAMESERVER is defined in Makefile.com.

4.  There are lot of bugs.  Many of them are so minor they have been
around since the early days of MMDFIIa and no one has bothered to fix them.
See above for information on how to retrieve the current bug list.

    /* What this routine needs is a table of time zones for sources,
       and to figure out which part of the time zone (daylight
       saving's time, etc.) from the time in the date. This needs the
       following additions: source host, table of which time zone each
       host is in (fixed list and/or UUCP Map data compiled), and
       table of time zones for locations, which is a part of most Unix
       distributions.  This is on my TODO list -u@q.net */

	* Whoa!  Make configure variables deterministic, the same,
	  and options for them all.  Right now, there's one name as
	  option to ./configure, a second name between ./configure and
	  Makefile.in, a third name from Makefile.in to
	  conf/<system>/*.[ch], and a fourth name inside of
	  conf/<system>/*.[ch], all different and seemingly random!
	  Oh, lest I forget, there's a fifth name space for the
	  mmdftailor file.  Very hard to update from old install given
	  diffs.  Just try to find how to put the table directory into
	  "/etc/mmdf" and the tailor file into "/etc/mmdf/tailor".  A
	  dozen windows open for one stupid update?  Give me a break!
	  (I had to update both ./configure and Makefile.in for this
	  local configuration, but someone here who knows GNU autoconf
	  should go through, make all the names exactly the same from
	  command line option all the way down to the variables used
	  in the code, and beyond to the mmdftailor file: this is
	  easy, go backwards from the mmdftailor file to the the conf
	  files to the sed code that is in Makefile.in to the
	  variables assigned by configure to the options to configure;
	  where changes must be made (e.g., case) the changes should
	  be deterministic: convert all lowercase to upper case, vice
	  versa, etc.: that's it!  No other ``well, I'll put a `_'
	  here, an `s' there, and let's throw in an `r' and a `d' for
	  good measure, but wait, let's insert "_MMDF" between "MM"
	  and the rest of the variable!'' crap!!!.)

	  If someone makes any changes to the FHS2.0 pathname
	  configurations I put together here for Linux (it's a bit
	  interdependent to the non-system dependent configuration
	  files like "configure" and "Makefile.in" as of yet since I
	  haven't fixed the above), let me know; that is, let me know
	  if there are any changes to Makefile.in or configure, so I
	  can update conf/linux*.  (This wouldn't be necessary without
	  configure and Makefile.in.)  The GNU autoconf stuff is great
	  if it's fully integrated, but it's half integrated so it
	  instead gets in the way and breaks stuff.  I'd be happy to
	  work on it if someone told me what to do: is Makefile.in and
	  "configure" the right place to start, or are those object
	  files of yet more source files?  Then, I can clean up the
	  mess with the names, set some decent defaults for systems
	  (like FHS2.0 for Linux systems), and do away with half (not
	  all) of the stuff under conf/ (keep them, but one set, not
	  many, as a simple back end to configure) -- have to keep
	  some of conf/ for stuff that isn't ./configure-able (like
	  hard-coded tailor files (I want to use this when I get the
	  time) and phone character bitmaps, functons, etc.)

	* move list of channel for smtpd/smtpsrvr to mmdftailor
	* possibility of binding smtpd to an specific interface with a 
	  list of channel for each interface
	* better address checking/authorization in smtpsrvr
	* channel-depend cleanque
	* rbl-support (blacklisted mail-host)
	* ESMTP implementation (the development-tree recognizes the
	  command, but has no further implementation behind)
	* wild-cards
	* ldap support

	* Don't know how to set the value of LOCALUTIL in Makefile.com
	  Need to determine a way to distinguish (lib/util/):
	  lk_lock.c, lk_lock.4.2.c, lk_lock.5.2.c, lk_lock.rand.c
	  	and
	  tai_file.c, tai_noop.c, tai_test.c
	  	and
	  gwdir.c, gwdir.4.2.c, gwdir.2.9.c
		and
	  getllog.bsd.c, getllog.fak.c, getllog.v7.c

	* Find a way to distinguish make depend in Makefile.com

	* workaround for lib/util/multcat.c and lib/util/multcpy.c if
	  <varargs.h> don't exists (like lib/util/arg2str.c e.g)

	* Makefile.com.in:
		definition of SYSTEM / SERVER_SYSTEM
		definition of LOCALUTIL

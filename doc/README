		How to make the Documentation

Unfortunately there is too much variation in document preparation
proceedures for me to make a Makefile for it, but here is the
basic info you need:

addressing:	troff -ms addressing

administrators:	administrators/Makefile

review/*:	troff -ms fnmacro p?

auth.guide:	troff -me auth.guide

authorization:	troff -me authorization

table.sample.kille:	pr table.sample.kille

uk.overview:	troff uk.overview  (Troff in the raw!)

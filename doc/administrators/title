The \*M mail system is a powerful but complex mail system
that requires a certain degree of care in its setup and maintenance.
This paper will try to give a step-by-step installation procedure
and will recommend how to maintain the \*M system on a day-to-day basis.
Topics covered include system generation,
runtime configuration, generation of channel
and domain tables, and tuning of the \*M system.

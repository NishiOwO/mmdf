 *
 *      STRUCTURES WHICH DESCRIBE CHANNELS
 *
 *  Ch_struct (typedef Chan) contains all of the parametric information
 *  about a channel.  There may be several telephone and/or pobox channels,
 *  but each type is exec'd from a single executable file, so that the
 *  structure provides distinguishing information.  For telephone channels,
 *  Ch_struct has a pointer to an extension structure, called ch_phstruct.
 *  The member is null for other channels.
 */

/*      TELEPHONE-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS
 *
 *  The existing "telephone" channel also is used for low-speed hardwired
 *  machine-machine exchange, through tty ports.
 *
 *  If a phone channel is inactive, by virtue of not having any mail going
 *  from the local machine to the "other side", then we may need to poll
 *  them, periodically, to see if they have any mail to be brought over.
 *  Currently, you are limited to specifying a delay time; ch_poltime
 *  indicates how many 15-minute units of time to wait, since the last
 *  completed exchange, before polling.  NOTE:  you cannot currently
 *  specify time-of-day / day-of-week windows.
 *
 *  In order to keep track of the channel's activity, the files _dstrt,
 *  _ddone, and _pdone are used to note when outbound delivery was last
 *  started, when it was last completed and when the last pickup (inbound
 *  retrieval) was last completed.  The files are zero-length and only
 *  their modification time is of interest.
 *
 *  Ch_access indicates that mail may be retrieved, as well as sent.
 *
 *  ch_script specifies the script file to be followed for creating a
 *  connection to the slave on the other machine.  it usually indicates
 *  what number to call or line to connect to, login sequence, and program
 *  to start running.  it's use is more fully described in the dial
 *  package's documentation.

/*      DESCRIPTION OF OUTPUT CHANNELS
 *
 *  For active channels, an attempt is made to send queued mail.  For
 *  passive channels, the mail is held until called for.  Some active
 *  channels may be invoked by anyone, others are restricted to the Deliver
 *  daemon (runnable an background).
 *
 *  A channel may have two "names".  One (ch_show) is intended for display
 *  and may contain any characters that will enhance its presentation.
 *  The other (ch_name) is intended for user input and more limited
 *  display.  It should have no special characters (e.g., dash, space) and
 *  should be entirely in lower case.  It must be unique.
 *
 *  A channel services a subset of the entire queue.  It access mail
 *  stored under the sub-queue, specified by ch_queue.  More than one
 *  channel may access a sub-queue, such as having an arpanet channel
 *  and a backup phone channel.
 *
 *  Each channel has an associated table, with the names of hosts on that
 *  channel.  The module, ch_table, handles access to the table and defines
 *  its format.  The local host is usually named in the table.  In order to
 *  capture references to the local machine, we need to know its "official"
 *  name in the table.  ch_lname permits this.
 *
 *  ch_ldomain specifies the RFC822 domain name to use, for this host,
 *  for the channel.
 *
 *  It also may allow some other special handling.  Usually, ch_lname is
 *  the same as the global, locname[], but this is not required.  For
 *  example, if there are several machines providing service to a single
 *  organization, you may want ch_lname to be an internal, local-network
 *  name for the local machine, while locname[] would be the public name
 *  for the organization.
 *
 *  Channels often involve contact with a single, other host, which acts as
 *  a relay for the other machines on a network.  If that is the case, then
 *  the "official" name of that host should be specified (ch_host).  This is
 *  particularly necessary when mail is picked up from (or submitted by)
 *  the relay, so that the Via: field can cite it.
 *
 *  When the channel is passive and a single site acts as a relay for the
 *  entire channel's mail, then there will be a single Unix login
 *  authorized to perform the pickup.  That must be indicated with
 *  ch_login.
 *
 *  If the channel is a telephone-like channel, then the above-described
 *  ch_wait, ch_access, ch_login, must be filled in.

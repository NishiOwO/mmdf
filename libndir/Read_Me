The purpose of this library is to simulate the new flexable length
directory names on top of the old directory structure. It allows
programs to be converted to the new directory access interface, so
that they need only be relinked when 4.2bsd becomes available.

The following files should be placed in /usr/src/lib/libndir; then run
``make'' followed by ``make install''. The manual page is available as
``man directory''. The library is accessed by specifying "-lndir" as the
last argument to the compile line. (eg ``cc -o foo foo.c -lndir'')

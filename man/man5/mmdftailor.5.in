mmdftailor \- MMDF runtime tailoring 
.SH SYNOPSIS
MMDF tailoring file
.SH DESCRIPTION

.bp
.NH
.B mmdftailor
is a database tailoring the properties of the \*M mail system.
It is accessed at each start of any part of the mailsystem (
\fBdeliver\fR, \fB...\fR).
.br
 Each entry in the file consists of a line (continuationlines are
denoted by indentation with space or tab).
.br
Each line consists of a keyword (see the list below) and the value(s), 
seperated by white space, tab or column.
.br
Comments should start with dash or semicolumn in the line.
.PP

.B MLNAME, MLOCHOST
"\fI<string>\fR"
.RS
The MLNAME is the name of your machine or site  as  you
wish  it  to be known throughout the network.  This may be a
generic host name used to hide a number of local hosts.   If
a  generic  host name, internal hosts will be differentiated
by MLOCMACHINE (described below).
.br
\fBMLOCHOST\fR is equivilent to \fBMLNAME\fR.
.RE

.B MLDOMAING
"\fI<string>\fR"
.RS
The MLDOMAIN line gives your full local domain.   This,
combined with the MLNAME (and possibly the MLOCMACHINE) will
give you the full network address.
.RE

.RS
The host knows itself as 
.I MLNAME.MLDOMAIN
The message is build upon
.I MLOCMACHINE.MLNAME.MLDOMAIN
.RE

.B MLOCMACHINE
"\fI<string>\fR"
.RS
The MLOCMACHINE line is often set to the  null  string,
unless  you are a large transparent site.  The normal use of
this is for a site which has several machines but wishes the
machines themselves to appear as one address.
.RE

.B MSIG
"\fI<Signature>\fR"
.RS
The string specified in the MSIG line is the fullname that MMDF will use
when notifying senders of mail delivery problems. This should be
something that indicates a message agent was responsible.

.RE

.B MSUPPORT
"\fI<email-address>\fR"
.RS
MSUPPORT is the address to which to send mail that MMDF
can't cope with (i.e. that MMDF can't deliver or return to
sender). Be sure MSUPPORT is a legal address!
.RE
.PP

.B AUTHREQUEST
"\fI<email-address>\fR"
.RS
AUTHREQUEST is the address to which users should mail if they have
questions about why a message was not authorized for delivery. It is
also used as the sender of authorization warning messages. It is not
used if authorization is not enabled on some channel.

.B MDBM

.RS
The  MDBM  line  tells  MMDF where to find the database
file containing the associative store.  Dbm style  databases
get  their  speed and flexibility by dynamic hashing and can
get quite large.  By default, the file  is  located  in  the
MTBLDIR  dirctory,  but it might need to be relocated due to
its size.

.B flags=
<\fIabort\fR | \fIchannel\fR |\fIdomain\fR |\fIpartial\fR |\fIroute\fR  | \fIreject\fR>
.RS
The flags parameter is used to indicate additional
properties about the table being defined.
This can be specified more than once for a given table to set
more than one flag.
Currently this is used to specify various table options - source type,
nameserver lookup parameters, and control of partial lookups.
.sp
\fIreject\fR is used within the smtp channel (incoming) to reject
blacklisted host. See also \fIrbl\fR see mmdf_rbl(5)
.sp
In the case of an ns-type table,
the ``flags'' field will also specify the type of nameserver lookup.
Currently ``domain'' and ``channel'' are supported.
.br
\fIDomain\fR indicates a lookup of the given address in the domain
specified by the dmn= parameter of the domain definition (e.g. for FOO.ARPA,
look up FOO in dmn=``ARPA'' or FOO.ARPA in dmn=``'').
.br
\fIChannel\fR indicates a lookup of the given fully-qualified domain
name to determine the address(es) to use in delivering via SMTP.
.br
(Note that there used to be a lookup type of ``root''.  This type no
longer exists--instead use a flags setting of ``domain''
in the table definition with a domain definition parameter of dmn=``''.)
.sp
When a domain is looked up in a domain table and no exact match exists, the
optional flag ``route'' determines whether a search should be done on
successive subdomains of the domain.  If a subdomain match is found, the
right-hand-side of the table entry is used as a route to the domain.  
For example,
the top domain table entry UKY.EDU:RELAY.UKY.EDU would cause routing via
RELAY.UKY.EDU for A.CS.UKY.EDU if the ``route'' flag were set.  This flag
essentially enables one table entry to act as a wildcard for a gateway to an
entire subdomain.  (Note that ``route'' used to be the default for all domain 
tables.  To get the same behavior, you must now explicity set the
``route'' flag.)
.sp
Generally, the MDMN ``dmn='' setting determines what domain tables will be
searched when looking up a domain name.  However, if an exact or "route-style"
match cannot be made in the standard domain tables, the optional flag
``partial'' controls whether the domain should be looked up in other domain
tables.  For example, if domain tables ARPA
and EDU have the ``partial'' flag set, an address of FOO
will generate lookups for FOO.ARPA
and FOO.EDU.  The ``partial'' flag is often used for the local domain table
to allow users to omit the full domain specification when referring to local
machines.  (Note that ``partial'' used to be the default for dbm-style tables.
To get the same behavior, you must now explicitly set the ``partial'' flag.)
.sp
Normally, when looking up a domain name in an ns-type domain table and a
timeout occurs, MMDF looks through the list of domains for other tables in
which to try the lookup.  To force MMDF to not try other tables after a
timeout, use the optional flag ``abort''.  ``Abort'' would normally be used
when this ns-type domain table is the only reliable source of information
about this domain (and when results would be confusing or incorrect if
alternate domain tables were consulted occasionally).

.B ALIAS
.I table=<table>, [trusted],[nobypass],[public]
.RS
Alias definitions are used to tell the system about the
various sources of alias information. \*M can have more than
one alias file. In addition, each alias source has the
option of being trusted and the option of preventing
bypassing (via the ~\ in front of an address).
.PP
Making an alias file trusted is a serious decision. A
trusted alias file can direct mail to be delivered to any
file or process using the permissions of any user on the
system. It should only be modifiable by the Superuser, or
guarded as such. Typically there is only one or two trusted
alias files per system.
.PP
The alias tables are searched in the order they are
defined. When a hit is made, no further searching is done
for additional hits in later tables.
.PP
.DE
\fItable\fR     Specifies name of the table to be associated with this
alias entry. 
.PP
\fItrusted\fR   The entries in the table will be allowed to cause
delivery to files and pipes.

.B lname= 
"\fI<string>\fR"
.RS
This specifies a name overriding the default MLNAME value when used in
this channel. This is the name by which the local host is known to
hosts accessed by this channel. This is used when the channel should
have non-standard values for the local domain. If locname = `UCL-CS'
and locdomain = `AC.UK', then for an arpa smtp channel, one would set
the parameters ldomain = `ARPA' (and, implicitly, lname =
`UCL-CS'). All local references in this channel would be mapped to
UCL-CS.ARPA if reformatting is used. For this mapping to take place,
domain lookups of the various names by which the local host is known
must all resolve to locname.locdomain. For example, the line
"UCL-CS:UCL-CS.AC.UK" must appear in both the ARPA and AC.UK domain
tables.

relayed to one host.) This is required on the badusers and badhosts
pseudo-channels. It is also required to be set to the local host
for the list channel.

.B poll= 
\fI<int>\fR
.RS
The frequency of polling the remote machine. A poll on a two-way
channel (such as the phone channel) is used to see if any mail is
waiting to be picked up from the remote host. A value of 0 disables
polling; a value of -1 requests polling to be done every time the
channel is started up. Any other value is the number of 15-minute
intervals to wait between polls. Note that the value of poll is
ignored if any mail is waiting to be sent; in this case, a connection
is always attempted.

This is a table of hosts that are known on this channel. If a known
table is specified and a given host is not in the table, then a relay
form of the address is used, specifying that the return address goes
through this host. This conversion occurs after appending
lname.ldomain (if appropriate--see above). Only the LHS of this table
is used; the RHS is ignored. The LHS should contain hosts, not
domains. Typically, channel tables double as ``known tables''. If the
table is an NS-type table, it must be a domain or top table, not a
channel table. Be sure that the table also contains your own fully
specified name (localhost.locdomain). Note that the ``known table''
must exist. A tailor entry will not define a ``known table'' that has
not been predefined.

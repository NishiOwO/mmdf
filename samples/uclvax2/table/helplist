This list is the first pass at a help list.  I hope that it
will be improved to become more helpful!   Eventually, all the
lists should have brief descriptions, and all the more detailed
documents will be assembled in one place.

UCL INTERNAL LISTS

Note:  Other regularly used lists are in fact the sum of two or
more of these lists.  A user should join those sublists which
seem appropriate.  In particular:
        all = staff + students
        students = 1styr + 2ndyr + 3rdyr + msc
        msc = mscit + msccs
        staff = research + academic

A full explanation of these lists will be found in the UCL
directory (in preparation)

/*
 *  CH_QNIFTP  --  Channel for reception of NIFTP/ JNT mail
 *
 *  This module is made to look like a channel although it is not really
 *
 *  The module is called by the NIFTP, but does not communicate
 *  with it except for the final exit value.  The module interacts
 *  with submit, and passes messages to it.
 *
 *  The major advantage of looking like a channel is that messages
 *  can pretent to submit that they have come in over a channel.
 *  The facilities of submit can then be used for management and
 *  other things (e.g. stamping Via: fields).
 *
 *  It should be called by the NIFTP with an execl of the form
 *  execl( path, name, niftp-queue, fname, TSname) where the parameters are
 *  character strings.  fname is the file containing the JNT mail
 *  format message, and TSname is the calling address of the host.
 *  MMDF will try to identify this as a real host.
 *  niftp-queue is the NIFTP queue name.  This is mapped into an
 *  MMDF channel name

The code was lint'ed.  No guarantees are made but there shouldn't be any
problems (famous last words).

--- TO DO ---
	Merge in edward's speed improvements
	Merge in guy's update to rfc822
NO	Add "Header" command to allow user defined headers.
		It will disallow "From", "Sender", "To", "Subject", "Cc", "Bcc"

--- DONE ---
cmd2.c	swrite()
	Made "write" command delete entire header instead of just 1st line
list.c	sender()
	Made "type user" do a substring match instead of straight comparison
	(this allows user to match user@machine, which makes it USEFUL)
cmd3.c	unread()
	unread/Unread/new/New command marks messages as unread
list.c	markall()
	Made "-" and "+" skip over deleted messages	(from guy@sun)
cmd1.c	type1()
	if PAGER variable is set, use it instead of MORE (#define)
		to paginate articles
cmd3.c	respond()
	if Replyall variable is set, do a "Reply" (e.g. reverse R and r)
cmd3.c	Respond()
	if Replyall variable is set, do a "reply" (e.g. reverse R and r)
main.c	main()
	Print header info even if -f given.
lex.c	setfile()
	Don't allow editing anything other than regular files.
aux.c	isatty()
	deleted isatty() - it's in the C library
aux.c	strncmp()
	deleted strncmp() - it's in the C library
cmd3.c	shell()
	Lint clean up:	0 -> (char *)0
cmd3.c	dosh()
	Lint clean up:	0 -> (char *)0
optim.c	rename()
	Fix uninitialized variable problem	(from guy@sun)
optim.c	rpair
	Fix uninitialized variable problem	(from guy@sun)
The following changes had to be made to MMDF for Berkeley Mail.

	adjusted ../../Makefile.com to have VMUNIX.
	added conf/SITE/Makefile.uip and changed conf/sitesetup

The following changes indicate how this version of Berkeley Mail
differs from the virgin version.

	change name of cmdtab to CmdTab so as not to conflict with
	the MMDF command table which is called cmdtab.

	use of MMDF routines to determine mail box location, etc.

	must have flock call because it is impossible to pass the
	filename around of the currently open file.  this means the
	lk_open/close interface is not exactly transparent.

	take advantage of knowing flock works by eliminating the
	CANLOCK option.

	add file mmdf.h

	add another parameter to send() to indicate whether or not
	the message being printed should be delimited with MMDF
	message delimiters.

	use the MMDF ml_*() routines to interface to MMDF when sending
	mail.  this is a total rewrite of mail1().

	sorry, but you lose blind carbon copies.

	mail1() no longer returns a meaningful value (of course it
	only did half the time before anyway).

	borrow ../other/adrparse.c and dateparse.c (from ../msg/msg6.c).

One last final note.  You should know that if you begin to use this version
of Mail I don't think that you will be able to switch back to the old
version (almost definitely if you are running MMDF, which I guess is
assumed).  I can not try this but it would seem to be the case.  So be
sure it is what you want to do before you start using it.

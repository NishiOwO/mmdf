Here is a couple of things that could stand to be done.

	If you are running 4.3bsd then undef all the sigmask's.

	I am surprised this runs as fast as it does.  Lots of things could
	be done to speed it up.  It just has too many open files that it
	reads and rereads and rereads.  How about a structure to store
	the headers for instance?

Running Lint:

I did this as of June 2, 1986  (Galvin).  I gave  up on trying  to eliminate
all the possible pointer conversion problems.  For some  reason lint insists
on complaining about all the "calloc" and "salloc" calls.

I  ifdef'ed  whole subprograms  which are   unused  with  "NOT_USED".  Those
subprograms which are actually available from the C library  I ifdef'ed with
NO_LIB.

Remember that all  routines  in  "CmdTab" must  return  zero or non-zero  as
appropriate.  Lint complains about return values that are not used but these
routines are called indirectly.

Untold numbers of  variables/parameters   which were  unused  were  deleted.
Quite a bit of type casting was also done.

What's left?  Mail works.  It probably should only be provided as an interim
facility, though.  Sites should really use msg/send.

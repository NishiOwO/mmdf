These are some useful programs that are not integrated into
the standard MMDF environment.  In particular, they do not use
the runtime tailoring or standarm MMDF library (values are
hardcoded).  However, they would be simple to "bring into the
fold", given a little time, and they may be useful as they
stand to many site.  Read them first and understand what you
are getting.
